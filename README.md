# FundingHer

Welcome to **FundingHer**, a decentralized crowdfunding platform designed to empower women-led projects through crypto donations. Built with security, transparency, and accessibility in mind, FundingHer enables anyone, anywhere, to support women-driven initiatives without intermediaries. 🚀💜

## Why FundingHer? 🤔

Women entrepreneurs and innovators often face funding challenges due to systemic barriers in traditional finance. **FundingHer** seeks to bridge this gap by leveraging blockchain technology to create a trustless, transparent, and censorship-resistant funding ecosystem.

- **Decentralized & Transparent** – Donations are recorded on the blockchain for full transparency.
- **No Banking Barriers** – Anyone with internet access and a crypto wallet can contribute.
- **Low Fees & Fast Transactions** – Bypass costly intermediaries.
- **Empowering Women Globally** – From startups to social impact projects, women-led initiatives get the support they deserve.

## How It Works 🛠️

1. **Project Owners Apply** – Women-led projects submit applications to be listed.
2. **Verification & Approval** – Our team (and smart contract logic) verify legitimacy to prevent fraud.
3. **Campaigns Go Live** – Approved projects receive a campaign page with funding details.
4. **Donors Contribute** – Users donate crypto to support projects they believe in.
5. **Smart Contract Escrow** – Funds are securely held and released based on predefined milestones.
6. **Project Success** – If the project meets its goal, funds are transferred to the project owner.

## Tech Stack 💻

- **Frontend**: React (Next.js), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Blockchain**: Solidity, Ethereum (ERC-20), Polygon integration (optional for lower fees)
